    <div class="about">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cristiano Ronaldo was born on February 5, 1985. He was the fourth child born to his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro and his father, Jose Dinis Aveiro in Funchal, an island of Madeira, Portugal.

        His father worked as a metropolitan gardener while his mother was a cook. Ronaldo was named after then-US President Ronald Reagen.
        
        Ronaldo has an elder brother, Hugo and older sisters, Elma and Liliana. While growing up, he and all his siblings shared a room.
        
        Ronaldo was raised as a Catholic. He played for an amateur team, Andorinha, before being signed by Sporting CP for 1,500 Euros after a three-day trial.
        
        Ronaldo stopped attending school so as to focus on his football career. Prior to that decision, he was expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher.
        
        His football dreams were threatened by a racing heart condition, but after undergoing surgery he resumed playing.

        <li><h3>Manchester United (2003–2009)</h3><br>
        <p>Ronaldo who was the first Portuguese signing by Manchester United had the most expensive signing for a teenager in the 2003–2004 season.

            He proved his worth as he became one of the best players in Europe. While Ronaldo played in England, he became the first player to break the 20-goal barrier and helped United claim their first League title in four years.</p>
            <br>
        <li><h3>Real Madrid (2009–2018)</h3><br>
       <p>Ronaldo secured a move to Real Madrid before the start of the 2009–2010 season, in a world-record transfer of 94 million Euros, with a 1 billion Euros buyout clause with His contract which was set to expire in 2015.

        The attendance of 80,000 fans at his presentation at the Santiago Bernabeu broke the 25-year record of 75,000 attendances at Diego Maradona’s Napoli presentation.

            His transfer was the highest for a player above 30 years old. Ronaldo attributed his move to Juventus to the need for a new challenge, but later said he opted for a transfer due to a lack of support from the club president.</p>
